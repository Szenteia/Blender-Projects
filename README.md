Hi, My name is Andr√°s Szentei. I recently started to learn Blender. I decided to go for both Hard Surface and animated Character modeling, 
because this two fields are my main interests, also for myself I will create low poly fantasy assets. If You find it interesting contact me via e-mail: szenteia@gmail.com
